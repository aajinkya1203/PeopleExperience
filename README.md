# PeopleExperience
A proposed feature to be included in the COVID-19 MH Team's page for getting the experience of people during the pandemic to create awareness!

>This is mini full-stack project and it was done in order to gain some insight into the COVID-19 statistics while at the same time helping the Team by contributing my part to a big movement by keeping a track of people's experience and the difficulties that they face inorder to create more awareness as to what is going on in different places / district which the media doesn't show us!
